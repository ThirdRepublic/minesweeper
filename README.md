# Minesweeper

This project was developed for my own amusement as well as my interest in solving puzzle games.  I enjoy solving puzzles such as Sudoku, KenKen, 1000 piece Jigsaw Puzzles, and minesweeper.  Since this was project created for my own amusement, I have appended custom images to represent the mines and etc.  The functionality of the game remains the same.  The first click will never result in a selecting a mine.  The standard modes of Beginner (8x8, 10 mines), Intermediate (16x16, 40 mines) and Expert (24x24, 99 mines) are accessible. My custom minesweeper can be played by clicking [here](http://thirdrepublicminesweeper.github.io/). Enjoy.
